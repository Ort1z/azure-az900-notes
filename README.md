# Microsoft Azure AZ-900 Certification Notes

Notes are broken into sections as markdown files. You can read them directly on Github.  

Organized as per the [syllabus](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY) from 02/25/2023 . Each section tries to directly answer the questions from the syllabus.  

There are some topics that may be on the exam that are not mentioned on the syllabus. I tried to include any I found in the notes.

Practice problems are html files because Github filters `<select>` tags in markdown. _It is best to view these files in a browser._ That way the answers are hidden but available to view on-click.
