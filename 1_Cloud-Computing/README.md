# Introduction to Cloud Computing


### Define cloud computing.
Computing services provided over the internet.

### Give examples of computing services.
1. Compute power: Pay for the amount of RAM and quality of processor.
2. Storage: Pay for how much disk space you use. Added bonus of easily replicating data across several servers. 

### Extra: Difference between RAM and processor.
RAM is the maximum "quantity" of work your computer can do at any given time. The processor is the speed at which you do the work.

### Why would I use a cloud service provider?
- Pay only for the services used. 
- Don't have to manage your own hardware resources.
- Scale or de-scale quickly.

### Describe the shared responsibility model.
### Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
### Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
### Describe the consumption-based model.
### Compare cloud pricing models.
